# Unstuck
Unstuck is an app devoted to tidying your mind. Many times questions may swirl and answers seem hard to come by. This brain saving app allows users to submit any question and generates an answer. The answers can range and can be customized by the user for tone etc. ![Unstuck Screenshot](/images/scrn.png))
